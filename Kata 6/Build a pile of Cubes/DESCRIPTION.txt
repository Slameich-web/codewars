Your task is to construct a building which will be a pile of n cubes. The cube at the bottom will have a volume of 
, the cube above will have a volume of 
, and so on until the top which will have a volume of 
.

You are given the total volume m of the building. Can you find the number n of cubes you will have to build?

The parameter of the function (find_nb, find-nb, findNb, ...) will be an integer m, and you have to return the integer n such as: 
 if such a n exists or -1 if there is no such n.

Examples:

findNb(1071225) --> 45

findNb(91716553919377) --> -1
